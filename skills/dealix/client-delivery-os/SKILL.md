# Dealix Client Delivery OS

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- handle a new client request
- turn a client idea into a scoped workflow
- build a delivery sprint
- create client intake, diagnosis, blueprint, proof pack, or handoff files
- automate the client delivery process
- make Dealix operate like a professional services/productized OS company

## Delivery doctrine

Do not begin with "what should we build?"

Begin with:

> What business outcome must the client get, and what workflow proves it?

Dealix delivers operating systems, not loose documents or one-off scripts.

## Files to inspect first

```text
docs/company/
docs/delivery/
docs/ops/
business/products/
scripts/delivery/
app/delivery/
clients/
reports/delivery/
reports/proof/
sales/
tests/*delivery*
```

## Required delivery phases

### 1. Intake

Create or update:

```text
clients/<client>/00_intake.md
clients/<client>/01_business_context.md
clients/<client>/02_current_tools.md
clients/<client>/03_pain_points.md
clients/<client>/04_requested_outcomes.md
clients/<client>/05_risks_and_constraints.md
```

### 2. Diagnosis

Create:

```text
clients/<client>/diagnosis/CURRENT_STATE_MAP.md
clients/<client>/diagnosis/BOTTLENECKS.md
clients/<client>/diagnosis/OPPORTUNITY_MAP.md
clients/<client>/diagnosis/RISK_REGISTER.md
clients/<client>/diagnosis/FIRST_WORKFLOW_RECOMMENDATION.md
clients/<client>/diagnosis/GO_NO_GO.md
```

### 3. Scope card

Every request must become a scope card:

```text
Request Name:
Business Outcome:
Primary User:
Current Pain:
Workflow Affected:
Inputs:
Outputs:
AI Role:
Human Review Required:
Data Sources:
Integrations:
Acceptance Criteria:
Out of Scope:
Risks:
Delivery Timeline:
Owner:
```

### 4. Blueprint

Create:

```text
clients/<client>/solution/SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md
clients/<client>/solution/WORKFLOW_MAP.md
clients/<client>/solution/DATA_MODEL.md
clients/<client>/solution/ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md
clients/<client>/solution/AI_BEHAVIOR_POLICY.md
clients/<client>/solution/REPORTING_MODEL.md
clients/<client>/solution/ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md
```

### 5. Build and validation

Build in stages:

- V0 proof version
- V1 operating version
- managed monthly OS

Each stage must include acceptance criteria and proof.

### 6. Proof pack

Create:

```text
clients/<client>/proof/PROOF_PACK.md
clients/<client>/proof/DELIVERY_LOG.md
clients/<client>/proof/BEFORE_AFTER.md
clients/<client>/proof/ACCEPTANCE_RESULTS.md
clients/<client>/proof/NEXT_30_DAYS.md
```

## Governance rules

- Flag sensitive data.
- Do not request more client data than needed.
- Never store secrets in repo.
- Mark personal/customer data clearly.
- Require human approval before external communications.
- Do not fabricate client results.

## Suggested commands

```bash
python scripts/delivery/onboard_client.py --client <client> || true
python scripts/delivery/run_delivery_day.py --client <client> || true
python scripts/delivery/generate_proof_pack.py --client <client> || true
make delivery-onboard CLIENT=<client> || true
make delivery-day CLIENT=<client> || true
make delivery-proof CLIENT=<client> || true
```

## Definition of done

A delivery sprint is complete when:

- intake is documented
- diagnosis is clear
- one workflow is scoped
- blueprint is created
- acceptance criteria are testable
- proof pack is generated
- next 30 days are defined
- risks and constraints are visible

## Final response format

```text
Client Delivery OS Status:
- client:
- phase:
- artifacts created:
- acceptance criteria:
- proof pack:
- risks:
- next action:
```
