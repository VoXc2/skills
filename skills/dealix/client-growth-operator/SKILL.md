# Dealix Client Growth Operator OS

## When to use

Use this skill when the user wants Dealix to work on behalf of a client to:

- understand the client's company and offer
- prepare outbound or follow-up actions
- generate email, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, call, or website-form tasks
- classify replies
- prepare negotiation responses
- suggest booking options
- prepare proposals
- update a commercial command room

## Operating position

The correct product is not "a bot that sends for the client".

The correct product is:

> Dealix Client Growth Operator OS: a controlled growth operator that prepares, ranks, reviews, and tracks growth actions across channels while humans approve sensitive external actions.

## Autonomy levels

Use these levels explicitly:

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| A0 Draft Only | Create drafts and reports only |
| A1 Assisted Operator | Create approval cards for human review |
| A2 Controlled Live | Send only through approved channel gates |
| A3 Restricted | Requires founder decision: pricing, contracts, discounts, guarantees, high-volume send |

Default level is A0 or A1.

## Required client profile

Build or request:

```text

target_customers
current_channels
current_offers

```

## Channel rules

### Email

Allowed by default: draft only.

Required:

- subject
- body
- recipient source
- unsubscribe line for commercial email
- owner approval card
- suppression-list check

### WhatsApp

Allowed by default: draft payload only.

Required before live use:

- opt-in proof
- approved template for outbound initiation
- stop keywords
- human escalation path
- rate limits
- audit log

### LinkedIn

Allowed: manual-assisted task only.

Never auto-DM, scrape, or simulate human behavior.

### Phone

Allowed: call task and call script.

Never robocall.

### Website form

Allowed: manual task and form draft.

Never automate mass website-form submission.

## Action card schema

Each action should include:

```text
account
contact
channel
why_this_account
pain_hypothesis
message_or_script
recommended_offer
risk_notes
approval_required
approval_buttons
next_followup_date
audit_event
```

Approval buttons:

```text
Approve
Edit
Skip
```

## Reply classification

Classify replies as:

```text
interested
send_details
price_objection
not_now
partnership
meeting_request
contract_request
trust_objection
wrong_person
stop_or_opt_out
unknown
```

## Safety constraints

- No fake proof.
- No guaranteed outcomes.
- No final pricing commitments without explicit guardrails.
- No live outbound without controlled-live approval.
- No WhatsApp without opt-in/template logic.
- No LinkedIn automation.
- Log every prepared action as `action_prepared_not_sent` unless it truly passed live gates.

## Suggested commands

```bash
python scripts/commercial/run_command_room_day.py || true
python scripts/commercial/generate_client_growth_actions.py || true
python scripts/commercial/generate_channel_control.py || true
python scripts/outbound/check_live_outbound_env.py || true
make outbound-dry || true
make channel-day || true
```

## Definition of done

A complete run produces:

- client operating profile
- prioritized account queue
- channel action cards
- reply classification guide
- proposal brief queue
- approval cards
- audit events
- live sends count equal to zero unless explicitly approved

## Final response format

```text
